The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a type.
Usually it was type="text/javascript".
It’s not required anymore. Also, the modern HTML standard totally changed the meaning of this attribute.
Now, it can be used for JavaScript modules.
But that’s an advanced topic, we’ll talk about modules in another part of the tutorial.
